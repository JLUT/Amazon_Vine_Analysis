# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. For my analysis purpose, I have taken the example of reviews on watches sold on Amazon.

**Summary**

From the data above we were able to find that there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program for the watch sales data set I have taken for my analysis. When calculating the vine reviews percentage we found that 31.91% of the total vine reviews are 5 stars. While calculating the percentage of the non-vine reviews we found that 51.81% of the total non-vine reviews are 5 stars. There is enough information in this dataset to state there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.

We should be doing an analysis of the entire data set of all sales in Amazon US sales to confirm that there is no positivity bias for review in the Vine program. This is important as I have just taken one data set of watch sales and it cannot be the representation of the entire data set.
